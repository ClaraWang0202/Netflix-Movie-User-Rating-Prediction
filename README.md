# Netflix-Movie-User-Rating-Prediction
A subset of the movie rating data from MovieLens was used to explore movie recommendation system problem. Using key concepts of
latent factor model, matrix factorization and optimization, two singular value decomposition (SVD) models were constructed. One model
was built using just SVD and the other model was built coupling
SVD with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) iterative optimization
method. The two models were compared using RMSE, and the SVD
model coupled with SGD was found to be a better fit for the data set.
